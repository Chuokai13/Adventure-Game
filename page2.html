    <p1> "Ow... My head is killing me" you say. 
        I look around my trying to get a hold of my surroundings. 
        I see a few boxes and a dim flickering light. "thats kind of annyoying." 
        I get up and try moving but I feel weak. "Where am I?"
        I try to move my legs to try to get the blood flow going.
        after a few minutes I get up and start to move around the room.
        I see a door and some boxes.
